# Approach-Runway-Detection-using-Faster-R-CNN
Runway detection using Faster R-CNN and PyTorch. Trained on the synthetic LARD dataset, this project analyzes real-world performance and failure modes. Includes a deep-dive error analysis on object scale, contrast, and feature ambiguity to diagnose the failure modes.
